        <h1>Communication Based Lessons</h1>

          I believe the best way to learn a language is to <b>study the theory 30% of the time and to put it into practice 70% of the time.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          I also believe that to have an effective learning experience <b>students must enjoy the process</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is why before I design the lessons I always find out what the <b>interests, curiosities, difficulties and favourite subjects</b> are of my students in order to create a <b>fun and engaging learning enviroment</b>.

            I normally use the method of the flipped classroom. In aÂ flipped classroom, students first watch or listen to grammar and vocabulary material on their own and then spend class time practicing and resolving any doubts. This method allows my students to <b>be prepared</b>, to have a more <b>active role</b>, to <b>learn faster</b> and to make the most <b>efficient use of class time</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though I prefer this method usually, <b>my priority is always my
            students</b> and what works better for them.
            I <b>adapt my lessons to the needs of every individual</b>.
