        <h1>Hello! I am Macarena,</h1>
        <p>
          I teach <b>Spanish online</b> to students all over the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          I live in Seville, the city where I am from, but <b>I have also lived in other cities</b> such as the UK where I started my career as a Spanish teacher.
        </p>

        <h2 class="pt-5">My passions</h2>
        <p>
          Traveling, watching films, nature, yoga, spending time with my
          family and my dog, learning languages, experiencing different cultures and teaching my language and culture to my students.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Do you share some of passions?</b> We can speak about it in your Spanish lessons.
        </p>

        <h2 class="pt-5">Do you want to learn Spanish with me in a fun and efficient way?</h2>

        <p>
          I consider myself to be a <b>creative, patient and emphathetic</b> teacher. I like my students to feel comfortable and relaxed during our lessons. That is the reason why I prepare the lessons taking into account <b>your interests, your needs</b> and <b>your confidence level.</b>
