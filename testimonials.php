        <h3 class="mt-md-5">I suppose I ought to make my recommendations in English as well as Spanish. Macarena is a super teacher and our lessons are always good fun. One to one lessons are tiring but I have learned a lot. I have no hesitation in recommending Macarena.</h3>

        <h3 class="mt-md-5">Macarena is a warm and friendly teacher who always helps me feel comfortable and confident during my lessons. She is very well organised and professional. Every week, I receive excellent resources which help me revise what I have learned and prepare for my next lesson. In a short period of time my confidence and ability in Spanish has really improved. I cannot recommend Macarena's lessons enough.</h3>

        <h3 class="mt-md-5">I am very pleased with my experience with Macarena! She has been teaching me Spanish since February 2020 and it has been fantastic. Macarena has really helped me understand and improve both my grammar and vocabulary and I like the way the lessons are structured. I really like the topics covered in each lesson and also the flexible timetable. I would therefore highly recommend Macarena to anyone interested in learning Spanish!</h3>

        <h3 class="mt-md-5 pd-4">Macarena has been teaching me Spanish for some time now (from October 2018) and I am still as enthusiastic about learning now as I was at the beginning.  This is solely due to her entertaining teaching style, her courteous, patient manner, and the intelligence with which she structures my learning programme.  It has been a pleasure for me getting to know her over this time.  I would highly recommend Macarena to anyone wishing to learn the Spanish language.</h3>

        <h3 class="mt-md-5">Macarena has been an amazing teacher and source of support along my journey in learning the Spanish language. She has always been kind, warm and personable and has developed a very effective and engaging remote online learning environment. Every session is very well organised with worksheets and additional material consistently available for my usage, and that I find extremely useful. Our conversations are also always constructive and relevant, drawing from Macarenaâ€™s fresh and first-hand perspective of Spain, a perspective I had not previously encountered. This has in turn given me insights into the Spanish culture and what day to day life in Spain is really like, both of which are important things to understand and learn about when engaging in a new language. Ultimately, my lessons with Macarena feel more like informal chat with a friend, providing the most engaging and real learning experience possible. I would recommend Macarena to anyone keen to learn Spanish in a fun, balanced environment with a teacher as professional and dedicated as she is kind and approachable.</h3>
